Compatibility Engine

This module handles the logic for calculating similarity
and compatibility scores between users, playlists, or track features.

Core Responsibilities:
- Retrieve or receive feature vectors (ex: from Spotify API or database)
- Normalize and preprocess input data for comparison
- Apply mathematical operations (ex: cosine similarity, weighted averages)
- Return compatibility scores or match rankings

Purpose:
Acts as the brain of the EchoLogz backendâ€”responsible for interpreting data
and generating the 'connection scores' that drive recommendations.

Typical Usage Example:
    from services.scores import calculate_compatibility

    score = calculate_compatibility(user1_vector, user2_vector)
    print(f"User Compatibility: {score:.2f}")
