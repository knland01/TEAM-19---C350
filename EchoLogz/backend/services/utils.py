"""
Utility Functions Module (utils.py)

This module contains reusable helper functions that support general backend operations 
throughout EchoLogz. These functions perform small, common, and framework-independent 
tasks that keep other modules (like `compatibility`, `crud`, or `main`) clean and focused.

Core Responsibilities:
- Provide lightweight, reusable utilities (e.g., normalization, timestamp formatting, 
  file path resolution, or vector math helpers)
- Serve as a centralized toolbox for minor data manipulation tasks
- Support core logic in the `services` and `database` layers without creating dependencies

Purpose:
Acts as the Swiss Army knife of the EchoLogz backend â€” simplifying repetitive logic, 
maintaining clean code structure, and ensuring consistency across modules.

Typical Usage Example:
    from services.utils import normalize_vector, timestamp_now

    normalized = normalize_vector([0.2, 0.4, 0.8])
    print(f"Normalized Vector: {normalized}")
    print(f"Timestamp: {timestamp_now()}")
