# Health Check Router

# This module defines the health and status endpoints for the EchoLogz backend.
# It provides lightweight routes used to confirm that the API, database, and related
# services are running correctly.

# Core Responsibilities:
# - Expose a `/health` endpoint to verify that the backend is online
# - Optionally check database connectivity and return status info
# - Provide a simple heartbeat for uptime monitoring or deployment validation

# Purpose:
# Acts as the backend’s “pulse monitor” — confirming that EchoLogz services
# are healthy and responsive. Often used by front-end apps, automated scripts,
# or server monitoring tools to ensure the system is operational.

# Typical Usage Example:
#     from fastapi import FastAPI
#     from backend.routers import health

#     app = FastAPI()
#     app.include_router(health.router)
